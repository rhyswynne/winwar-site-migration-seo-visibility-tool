Description: Checks if a site has been migrated and if it's inivisible to search engines. If so, then the site warns you to review this setting.

== Description ==
This plugin is designed for people who has a developmental site that is different from the live site.

This plugin will warn you should you have blocked search engines in your blog. If you then move the database from your developmental site to your live installation, or change your blog's domain URL, then the warning will reappear, and not move until you have either unblocked search engines or made the plugin aware you have changed domains.

It's designed to help stop you accidentally blocking your live WordPress installation from search engines.
